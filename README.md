Intro

This library seeks to supply algorithms for converting nutrition data (as supplied by the United States government) into JSON.  I was not able to find any usage restrictions for the nutritional information, so be sure to abide by any laws or regulations applicable.

The nutritional information is not included by default, but can be found [here](http://www.ars.usda.gov/).  The raw data can be found [here](http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=20959).  The last link was active at the time this was written.

This library was created for compatibility with SR23.
